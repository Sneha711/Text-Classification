# Text-Classification
Text Classification of labelled documents using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms such as Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Artificial Neural Network Model. These algorithms are applied on some real experimental dataset such as Reuters corpus, Brown corpus and Movie review corpus.
